We started with the basics of reinforcement learning and understood all the terminologies like policy, value functions etc. Then we went on to markov decision process and markov reward process where we completely know the dynamics of the environment that are the transition probablities from one state to other, rewards on taking certain action etc. MDP are basic framework or the foundation of any agent environment interface but there can be environment where we are unaware or partially aware the dynamics. Then we studied Dynamic Programming which is used to evaluate the policy and even improve the policy using greedy methods. We studied two methods to solve the model free prediction that is when the environment is not known to us, Montecarlo method and Temporal difference learning. When we were done with the theory we started to code to train different environments on openAI gym using Q-learning and Deep Q-learning. I have completed training Mountaincar-v0, cartpole and frozen lake.
